# sample
<p>Most of the algorithms described in the class expects input as a vector. However, the reviews are natural language text of varying number of words. So the first step would be to convert this varying length movie review to a fixed length vector representation. We will consider vectorizing the natural language text into binary bag-of-words representation
<p>We used the F1-measure as the evaluation metric, and trained Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Linear SVM for this task.
