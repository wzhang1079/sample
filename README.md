<p>Design of a sentiment classifier for classifying the sentiment of the reviews in IMDB dataset. This is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where the input is a natural language text and output is the sentiment label. We will consider vectorizing the natural language text into binary bag-of-words representation
<p>We used the F1-measure as the evaluation metric. Using scikit-learn library in python, we trained Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Linear SVM for this task.
